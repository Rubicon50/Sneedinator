## Welcome to ProjeCturne!*(name to be edited later)*

This is a bullet-hell game made in Python. 
It was heavily inspired by the Touhou games (since they're the most well-known bullet-hell games, and the only series in the bullet hell genre that 2/3 of our group have played), and you can see this inspiration in the gameplay.

However, there is one innovation we wanted to make, inspired by the fact that swords are cool as hell.

*The melee system*, which encourages players to get up close and personal with bullets to use the sword, which allows you to cut bullets and erase them from the screen. It also does massive damage against bosses, however getting close to bosses is extremely difficult. We hope you experiment with the melee system and the regular shooting mechanics, and find a playstyle that suits you.
