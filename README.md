## Welcome to the unnamed bullet hell project.
*By: Caleb Ocana, Bradley Carey, and Ryan Hall*

This is a bullet-hell game made in Python. 
It was heavily inspired by the Touhou games (which are basically the only well-known bullet hell games anyway).

Unfortunately, the project took more time and effort than expected and is unfinished. 
The game is playable and the mechanics all function as intended, but the visual assets are all placeholders and there's no music or sound effects.
As well, there's only 1 "level" (if it can even be called that) which just features a couple enemies.
So this is more of a proof-of-concept than a proper game.
